## Introduction
**HofUniversityManager** is an application to manage everyday student life. It is specially made for the various services such as mensa or timetables of Hof University.

The application was developed as part of the Software Engineering 2 module in a group work in the third semester of our studies. It is written in Java 15 with the JavaFX framework in version 11. It runs on Windows and on macOS and it should run on Linux but we couldn't test it. Due to being the first larger programming project of the group members it still contains some bugs and offers many optimization options.
